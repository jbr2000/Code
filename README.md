Artificial Intelligence
The only project in this class was a robot localization program.
A grid-world is generated and at each step the "robot" makes observations
about how many walls are in which direction. After X steps the robot tries
to best estimate which square he occupies in the grid-world.

## iOS
Many of these are from my sophomore year at Chico.
Switchfit was a summer project that my friend and I did for fun.
The backend server is no longer running, so the app won't display any information.
Everything Magic was my Senior Project. The backend for that was Parse which was
maintained by facebook, but they will be terminating that service soon.

## miscWeb
Just small web projects I did.
Resume was for fun, while MaxPreps was for an interview. They wanted me to display
basic javascript knowledge.
